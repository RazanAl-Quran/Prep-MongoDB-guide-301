# Mongodb

## Uninstall the MongoDB

1. Stop MongoDB.
Stop the mongod process by issuing the following command:  
`sudo service mongodb stop`

2. Remove Packages.
Remove any MongoDB packages that you had previously installed.  
`sudo apt-get purge mongodb-org*`

3. Remove Data Directories.
Remove MongoDB databases and log files  
`sudo rm -r /var/log/mongodb`  
`sudo rm -r /var/lib/mongodb`  
or by using one command  
`sudo rm -r /var/log/mongodb /var/lib/mongodb`

* extra commands to uninstall.  
`sudo apt-get purge mongodb mongodb-clients mongodb-server mongodb-dev`  
`sudo apt-get purge mongodb-10gen`  
`sudo apt-get autoremove`  

Some of those commands may fail, depending on what packages you actually have installed, but that's okay.

This should also remove your config from /etc/mongodb.conf.

### Note

if you did the steps in the [Microsoftâ€™s directions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-database#install-mongodb), you may have created a directory named "data", remove this directory by:
`rm -rf data`

## install MongoDB in WSL

1. Update your Ubuntu packages.  
`sudo apt-get update`

2. Install MongoDB packages.  
`sudo apt-get install mongodb`

3. Confirm installation and get the version number.  
`mongo --version`

4. Check the status.  
`sudo service mongodb status`

5. Run the server.  
`sudo service mongodb start`

6. Start mongo console.  
`mongo`

### Start MongoDB using the operating system's built-in init system

In the example above we ran MongoDB directly. Other tutorials may start MongoDB using the operating system's built-in init system. You might see the command `sudo systemctl status mongodb` used in tutorials or articles. Currently WSL does not have support for systemd (a service management system in Linux).

You shouldn't notice a difference, but if a tutorial recommends using sudo systemctl, instead use: sudo /etc/init.d/.

* For example:  
`sudo systemctl status mongodb`, for WSL would be `sudo /etc/inid.d/mongodb status` ...or you can also use `sudo service mongodb status`.

### Repair

in some cases, you may have a problem while starting the service
try to do a repair by Following the steps:

1. Remove lock file.  
`sudo rm /var/lib/mongodb/mongod.lock`

2. Repair mongodb.  
`mongod --repair`

3. Start mongodb.  
`sudo service mongodb start`

4. Start mongo console.  
`mongo`

if that did not works, you probably faced a problem during the installation.  
try to uninstall and install again.
